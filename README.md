##This is a 3d/4d game that I am working on. 

I have not decided on a name or started working on the game's design. I only have a basic 3d engine that doesn't work too well, and a couple ideas for algorithms to make it sort of 4d. If you think of any good mechanics, ideas for what the game should be, or a name for it, edit this file and add it here.
